# SplunkSetupLab
📦 Splunk Deployment on Linux + Log Source Integration

This project documents my hands-on experience installing and configuring Splunk Enterprise in a Linux environment. The focus of the lab is building a functioning SIEM setup capable of ingesting logs from a host using a combination of listening ports and a Universal Forwarder.
