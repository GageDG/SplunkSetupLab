# SplunkSetupLab
📦 Splunk Deployment on Linux & Windows + Log Source Integration

This project documents my hands-on experience installing and configuring Splunk Enterprise across both Linux and Windows environments. The focus of the lab is building a functioning SIEM setup capable of ingesting logs from multiple hosts using a combination of listening ports and Universal Forwarders.
